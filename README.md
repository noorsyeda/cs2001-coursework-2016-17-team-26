# Group Poject 26

During term 1 we have been using another repository located at https://github.com/Chalikov/group26 (sorry)

This is an application that uses image recognition AI to identify objects from images. The app allows the user to capture images using phone camera or to select directly from gallery. Next, the captured/selected image is being uploaded to server. The server processes and returns a string that names the object(s) from the image.
